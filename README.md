# UTB-Smart-Chatbot ðŸš€

UTB-Smart-Chatbot is an interactive chatbot that provides information about the undergraduate programs offered by the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica de BolÃ­var (UTB). The chatbot leverages first-order logic using PyDatalog for knowledge representation and inference, combined with a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to match user queries with the corresponding program information. It also features text normalization (to handle accents), a query history to avoid repetition, and special responses for thanks and farewells. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Features & Stuff ðŸ˜Ž

- **First-Order Logic Knowledge Base:**  
  Programs are stored as facts with PyDatalog. Rules help infer extra info (like which faculty a program belongs to).

- **BFS Keyword Matching:**  
  A keyword graph maps your query to the right program using a BFS algorithm. The process involves:
  - **Text Normalization:** Input strings are normalized (accents removed, converted to lowercase) for better matching.
  - **Graph Traversal:** The BFS algorithm explores related keywords to find the official program name.

- **Query History:**  
  The bot keeps track of what you've already asked and asks if you want to see the info again. ðŸ”„

- **Special Responses:**  
  Custom replies are provided for thanks ("gracias", etc.) and farewells ("adiÃ³s", "chao", etc.).

- **Extensibility:**  
  New programs (including those from the School of Engineering, Architecture and Design, and the School of Digital Transformation) can be added easily.

- **Planned Diagrams:**  
  Activity diagrams and use case diagrams will be added later to illustrate system processes and interactions. ðŸ“Š
