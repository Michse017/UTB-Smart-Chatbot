# UTB-Smart-Chatbot ðŸš€

UTB-Smart-Chatbot is an interactive chatbot that provides information about undergraduate programs at Universidad TecnolÃ³gica de BolÃ­var (UTB). It leverages first-order logic with PyDatalog for knowledge representation and inference, a BFS algorithm for keyword matching, text normalization, query history tracking, and custom responses for gratitude and farewells.

## Features & Stuff ðŸ˜Ž

- **First-Order Logic Knowledge Base**  
  Programs are stored as PyDatalog facts with rules to infer additional details like faculty affiliations.

- **BFS Keyword Matching**  
  Uses a keyword graph and BFS algorithm to map user queries (including synonyms) to official program names.

- **Text Normalization**  
  Normalizes input text by removing accents and converting to lowercase for consistent matching.

- **Query History Tracking**  
  Maintains a history of user queries to avoid repetition and prompts users if they repeat a question. ðŸ”„

- **Special Responses**  
  Custom replies for gratitude ("gracias") and farewells ("adiÃ³s", "chao").

- **Extensibility**  
  Easily add new programs from different schools (e.g., Engineering, Digital Transformation).

## Diagrams ðŸ“Š (Planned)
